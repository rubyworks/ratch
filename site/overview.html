    <h1 class="top">What Is It?</h1>

    <p>Ratch is a Domain Specific Language for writing Ruby-based batch scripts.</p>

    <pre style="margin: 20px 0 20px 0; font-size: 8pt;">
    #!/usr/bin/env ratch

    # Get a list of entries from
    # the present working directory.

    entries = work.entries

    entries.each do |entry|
      if entry.directory?
        report "#{entry} is a directory"
      else
        report "#{entry} is a file"
      end
    end
    </pre>

    <p>Ratch provides support for dependency-oriented programming too.</p>

    <pre style="margin: 20px 0 20px 0; font-size: 8pt;">
    #!/usr/bin/env ratch

    task :document => [:rdoc, :ri]

    task :rdoc do
      shell 'rdoc -o doc/roc'
    end

    task :ri do
      shell 'rdoc --ri -o doc/ri'
    end
    </pre>

    <p>Ratch has a plethora of functionality for building any kind of script, making it easier and
    more intuitive.</p>

    <p>Ratch is still fairly early in development, so some parts of the API continue to change.
    However the main parts of ratch are stable and Ratch is already quite usable.</p>

    <h1 class="top">What's New</h1>

    <h3 class="date">2008-08-17</h3>

    <h2>First Release</h2>

    <p>The first release of Ratch is hitting the streets. I still consider beta ware, but is quite
    usable nonetheless. There are still some important polishings left to do, and some major features
    left to add (better support for command line options, task support, etc.). Even so, the system
    is goog enough that I <a href="http://reap.rubyforge.org">Reap</a> is using it as a very instrumental 
    dependency.</p>

    <h3 class="date">2008-07-23</h3>

    <h2>Wild Road</h2>

    <p>Ratch was born out of a long process to create a better build tool. Initially that process began with the
    original version of <a href="http://reap.rubyforge.org">Reap</a>. Reap went through a number of revisions, and ultimately evolved into
    a new project called Ratchets. Ratchets however was a monster, and the more I worked on it the more it became
    clear that it would not suffice. I simplified the design a relabeled the result Ratch. This new system was
    based on the design of tasks as stand-alone scripts that could easily depend on each other, much like rake
    tasks. It's was a very interesting system, and in some ways extremely appealing, most noteably for it's
    unix-esque approach. However, this design too ultimately proved too unwieldy. So I took a step back and
    reconsider everything I has learned during the development process, took some time to read up on other
    build tools, and reappled myself to the task afresh. The end result became three separate prjoects, 
    each simpler, more focused and well designed than anything that has come before: Ratch, Sow and the
    all new Reap. Ratch provides the backbone to Reap's services. </p>
